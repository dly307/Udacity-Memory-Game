## Instructions

This is a matching game.  There are sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid.  The gameboard is consists of eight different pairs of cards, each with a different symbol on one side.  The cards are randomly placed on the grid with the symbol facing down.  The rules are very simple:  Turn over one card at a time (max of two cards facing up at a time) and locate the ones that match!  Best of luck!
